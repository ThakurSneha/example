Here's a simple example of code using scikit-learn to train a basic machine learning model, specifically a decision tree classifier, on a sample dataset.

This code demonstrates a typical workflow for training a machine learning model using scikit-learn:

Loading a dataset (in this case, the famous Iris dataset).
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Initializing a machine learning model (in this case, a decision tree classifier).
Training the model on the training data.
Making predictions on the testing data.
Evaluating the model's performance (in this case, calculating the accuracy).
